BootUpdateManager (BUM)
=======================

This is custom code developed by Safayet Ahmed at GE Global Research.
It is used to initially load the EFI certificates for UEFI secure boot
as well as to manage updates and roll backs to the boot loaders.

The BUM software must be cloned in to the EDK2 directory and built
within that directly.

Clone the directory into the edk2 root directory.  Then build by
running the following command:

    $ build -p BootUpdateManager/BootUpdateManager.dsc

The EFI bindary should be somewhere under BootUpdateManager/Build/.
For example:

    <path-to-edk2>/BootUpdateManager/Build/RELEASE_GCC49/X64/BootUpdateManager/BootUpdateManager/OUTPUT/BootUpdateManager.efi

In order to build, the EDK2 environment must be configured as per
instructions.  This will define the compiler and the target build
architecture (among other things).
